# VR Games
I'm going to make 6 VR games (prototypes) this year. 0.5 VR game a month.

## 3. Five seconds [VR Hamburger Consuming Simulator]

The goal is to consume hamburgers when they land on the ground before their 5 seconds timer is passed. 

The VR Game is heavily inspired by "Dorohedoro" and "How I met your mother" TV shows.

You are a secret agent of a secret health organization. The organization made you small like a bunch of atoms and sent you to fight against a hazardous unknown disease. It turned out that it was aliens from a different parallel world.

It's an incredible story about a war against balloons. Ballons suck people's souls to be inflated, and your mission is to stop them from doing this.

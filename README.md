I'm going to make 6 VR games (prototypes) this year. 0.5 VR game a month.

It's an incredible story about a war against balloons. Ballons suck people's souls to be inflated, and your mission is to stop them from doing this.

You are a secret agent of a secret health organization. The organization made you small like a bunch of atoms and sent you to fight against a hazardous unknown disease. It turned out that it was aliens from a different parallel world.
